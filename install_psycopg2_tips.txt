#getting psycopg2 installed is a tremendous pain
#here is how you can get it done on a debian based linux system
#first update your system
sudo apt-get update

#then install this, SPECIFICALLY
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip

#try to install, but it's still going to fail
pip3 install psycopg2

#now be sure to CLEAR your terminal before proceeding
clear
sudo apt install libpq-dev python3-dev
pip3 install psycopg2

#finally! check your installation and see that no error msg is output
python3 -c "import psycopg2";

#if you ran that last cpmmand and nothing happened, you are all good!
